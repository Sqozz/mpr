A small serverscript which maintains a voting database for MPD songs.

**Current dependencies:
>flask - http://flask.pocoo.org/ - When web comes into the game, flask is the weapon of my choice.
>python-mpd2 - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-mpd2 - Maybe the first MPD-lib i found. It just do the things i want :)

You can install both over pip.
>sudo pip install flask && sudo pip install python-mpd2
